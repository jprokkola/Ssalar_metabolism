### Functions for filtering oxygen concentration data from metabolic rate measurements
### Jenni Prokkola, Eirik Ã…sheim, Tutku Aykanat

# Previous method used manual curating based on 1. R2 of the total slope, and 2. visual assessment of linearity for every slope. With high-resolution data,
# R2 filtering usually only captures very bad slopes so additional filters are needed.
# Here, functions developed to identify linear slopes using a combination of
# quadratic slopes, linear regression residuals, and R2 filtering. 

# Basic functions
# Function for lm
lmf<- function(x) {
  lm(x ~ c(1:length(x)), na.action = na.exclude)
}

# Function for R2 values
rsqf <-function(x) {
  summary(lmf(x))$r.squared
}


###--- Function 1 = rsq.outliers.f ----###
# Rsq. and outlier-filter function that 1. calculates linear slope r-square value, 
# and 2. filters measurements based on r2 threshold, 3. identifies and replaces outlier-
# data points with NA (defined as residuals of linear regression), and 
# 4. excludes the whole slope (replace with 0's) if too many NAs (>10%)
# 5. saves outputs in lists instead of data frames (four oxygen probes per list element)
# Outputs several lists: r2values, datalist, NAcounts, f1.output and excl.slop.f1

# Input data is table of raw data after correction for background respiration, only M phases, one value/second (original had 0.5/s)
# bq is a vector or batches and probe quadrants (B1.Q1 etc). Batches indicate measurements from different days.

rsq.outliers.f <- function(data, bq){ 
  # Make a new list with r2 values for each quadrant in each batch
